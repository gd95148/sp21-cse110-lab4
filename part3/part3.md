## Part 1 & 2
1) The bug in this program is our inputs num1 and num2 are string data types and when they are added together they simply concatenate. We must convert them to their numeric equivalents.
2) What I did to fix this problem was by casting the num1 and num2 into integers so when the addition operator is used we can actually retreive the sum.
